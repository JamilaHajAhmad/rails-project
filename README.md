# Polymorphism in RoR
Polymorphism in Ruby on Rails (RoR) refers to a feature of Active Record associations that allows a model to interact with multiple other models through a single interface. This is implemented using polymorphic associations, which enable a single model to belong to multiple other models on a single association. For example, a Comment model could belong to both a Post model and a Photo model, allowing for greater flexibility and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

It's advisable to consult the official Rails documentation for more detailed information and examples.
